Many researchers vote for a combination of research perspectives and their respective research methodologies; rigour and relevance as requirements in design science are generally accepted. What has been lacking is a formalisation of a detailed research process for design science that takes into account all requirements. We have developed such a research process, building on top of existing processes and findings from design research. The process combines qualitative and quantitative research and references well-known research methods. Publication possibilities and self-contained work packages are recommended. Case studies using the process are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identiﬁcation and motivation, deﬁnition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisﬁes the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract = {Posing research questions is a fundamental step to guide and direct knowledge development in research. In design science research (DSR), research questions are important to define the scope and the modes of inquiry, characterize the artifacts, and communicate the contributions. Despite the importance of research questions, there are few guidelines on how to construct suitable DSR research questions. We fill this gap by exploring ways of constructing DSR research questions and analyzing the research questions in a sample of 104 DSR publications. The results show that about two thirds of the analyzed DSR publications actually use research questions to link their problem statements to research approaches and that most of the questions are aimed at problem-solving. Based on our analysis, we derive a typology of DSR question formulation to provide guidelines and patterns that help researchers formulate research questions during their DSR projects’ duration.},

  title = {Collaborative {{Product Configuration}}:},
  volume = {3},
  abstract = {In the Software Product Line approach, product configuration is a key activity in which stakeholders choose features for a product. This activity is critical in the sense that careless feature selections might lead to undesirable products. Even though product configuration is seen as a team activity in which divergent interests and views are merged into a single consistent product specification, current configuration technology is essentially single-userbased. This configuration approach can be error-prone and time-consuming as it usually requires numerous interactions between the product manager and the stakeholders to resolve decision conflicts. To tackle this problem we have proposed an approach called “Collaborative Product Configuration” (CPC). In this paper, we extend the CPC approach by providing efficient dependency analysis algorithms to support the validation of workflow-based descriptions called CPC plans. In addition, we add to previous work by providing a formal description of the approach’s concepts, an augmented illustrated example, and a discussion covering several prototype tools now available.},

In such settings it is also assumed that only single users conﬁgure the corresponding products and services. Nowadays, a couple of scenarios exist that require more openness: it should be possible to cooperatively develop knowledge bases and to jointly conﬁgure products and services, even by adding new features or constraints in a ﬂexible fashion. We denote this integration of groups of users into conﬁguration-related tasks as open conﬁguration. In this paper we introduce features of open conﬁguration environments and potential approaches to implement these features.},

In this paper we present the results of an empirical analysis of the eﬀects of applying group recommendation technologies to requirements negotiation. This analysis has been conducted within the scope of software development projects at our university where development teams were supported with group recommendation technologies when deciding which requirements should be implemented. A major result of the study is that group recommendation technologies can improve the perceived usability (in certain cases) and the perceived quality of decision support. Furthermore, it is not recommended to disclose preferences of individual group members at the beginning of a decision process – this could lead to an insuﬃcient exchange of decision-relevant information.},

These companies provide Configuration Systems where a user can decide and discard which features she wants in her final product. However, although almost all of these systems support individual decisions, usually they do not offer an special support for decisions made by multiple users for the same product. This paper introduces Multi-SPLOT, a web-based Configuration System that supports simultaneous decisions from multiple users. This system uses off-the-shelf solvers to determine if these decisions are not conflicting among them, and to propose solutions when the decisions of an user conflict with decisions of the others. This paper shows the design of the solution and details of its implementation using Angular, Firebase and the optimization library in Google App Script.},

In cases where the requirements of the group members are inconsistent with the underlying constraint set, the group needs to be supported such that an appropriate solution can be found. In this paper, we present a guided approach that determines socially-aware diagnoses based on different aggregation functions. We analyzed the prediction quality of different aggregation functions by using data collected in a user study. The results indicate that those diagnoses guided by the Least Misery aggregation function achieve a higher prediction quality compared to the Average Voting, Most Pleasure, and Majority Voting. Moreover, another major outcome of our work reveals that diagnoses based on aggregation functions outperform basic approaches such as Breadth First Search and Direct Diagnosis.},

In general, the more ratings are elicited from the users, the more effective the recommendations are. However, the usefulness of each rating may vary significantly, i.e., different ratings may bring a different amount and type of information about the user’s tastes. Hence, specific techniques, which are defined as “active learning strategies”, can be used to selectively choose the items to be presented to the user for rating. In fact, an active learning strategy identifies and adopts criteria for obtaining data that better reflects users’ preferences and enables to generate better recommendations.},
