Many researchers vote for a combination of research perspectives and their respective research methodologies; rigour and relevance as requirements in design science are generally accepted. What has been lacking is a formalisation of a detailed research process for design science that takes into account all requirements. We have developed such a research process, building on top of existing processes and findings from design research. The process combines qualitative and quantitative research and references well-known research methods. Publication possibilities and self-contained work packages are recommended. Case studies using the process are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identiﬁcation and motivation, deﬁnition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisﬁes the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

In design science research (DSR), research questions are important to define the scope and the modes of inquiry, characterize the artifacts, and communicate the contributions. Despite the importance of research questions, there are few guidelines on how to construct suitable DSR research questions. We fill this gap by exploring ways of constructing DSR research questions and analyzing the research questions in a sample of 104 DSR publications. The results show that about two thirds of the analyzed DSR publications actually use research questions to link their problem statements to research approaches and that most of the questions are aimed at problem-solving. Based on our analysis, we derive a typology of DSR question formulation to provide guidelines and patterns that help researchers formulate research questions during their DSR projects’ duration.},

  abstract = {In the Software Product Line approach, product configuration is a key activity in which stakeholders choose features for a product. This activity is critical in the sense that careless feature selections might lead to undesirable products. Even though product configuration is seen as a team activity in which divergent interests and views are merged into a single consistent product specification, current configuration technology is essentially single-userbased. This configuration approach can be error-prone and time-consuming as it usually requires numerous interactions between the product manager and the stakeholders to resolve decision conflicts. To tackle this problem we have proposed an approach called “Collaborative Product Configuration” (CPC). In this paper, we extend the CPC approach by providing efficient dependency analysis algorithms to support the validation of workflow-based descriptions called CPC plans. In addition, we add to previous work by providing a formal description of the approach’s concepts, an augmented illustrated example, and a discussion covering several prototype tools now available.},

In such settings it is also assumed that only single users conﬁgure the corresponding products and services. Nowadays, a couple of scenarios exist that require more openness: it should be possible to cooperatively develop knowledge bases and to jointly conﬁgure products and services, even by adding new features or constraints in a ﬂexible fashion. We denote this integration of groups of users into conﬁguration-related tasks as open conﬁguration. In this paper we introduce features of open conﬁguration environments and potential approaches to implement these features.},

In this paper we present the results of an empirical analysis of the eﬀects of applying group recommendation technologies to requirements negotiation. This analysis has been conducted within the scope of software development projects at our university where development teams were supported with group recommendation technologies when deciding which requirements should be implemented. A major result of the study is that group recommendation technologies can improve the perceived usability (in certain cases) and the perceived quality of decision support. Furthermore, it is not recommended to disclose preferences of individual group members at the beginning of a decision process – this could lead to an insuﬃcient exchange of decision-relevant information.},

However, although almost all of these systems support individual decisions, usually they do not offer an special support for decisions made by multiple users for the same product. This paper introduces Multi-SPLOT, a web-based Configuration System that supports simultaneous decisions from multiple users. This system uses off-the-shelf solvers to determine if these decisions are not conflicting among them, and to propose solutions when the decisions of an user conflict with decisions of the others. This paper shows the design of the solution and details of its implementation using Angular, Firebase and the optimization library in Google App Script.},

In cases where the requirements of the group members are inconsistent with the underlying constraint set, the group needs to be supported such that an appropriate solution can be found. In this paper, we present a guided approach that determines socially-aware diagnoses based on different aggregation functions. We analyzed the prediction quality of different aggregation functions by using data collected in a user study. The results indicate that those diagnoses guided by the Least Misery aggregation function achieve a higher prediction quality compared to the Average Voting, Most Pleasure, and Majority Voting. Moreover, another major outcome of our work reveals that diagnoses based on aggregation functions outperform basic approaches such as Breadth First Search and Direct Diagnosis.},

However, the usefulness of each rating may vary significantly, i.e., different ratings may bring a different amount and type of information about the user’s tastes. Hence, specific techniques, which are defined as “active learning strategies”, can be used to selectively choose the items to be presented to the user for rating. In fact, an active learning strategy identifies and adopts criteria for obtaining data that better reflects users’ preferences and enables to generate better recommendations.},

The platform selects sponsored items to maximize ad revenue, often through some form of programmatic auction, and non-sponsored items to maximize user utility with a recommender system (RS). We develop a multiobjective binary integer programming model to allocate sponsored recommendations considering a dual objective of maximizing ad revenue and user utility. We propose an algorithm to solve it in a computationally efficient way. Our method can be applied as a form of post processing to an existing RS, making it widely applicable. We apply the model to data from an online grocery retailer and show that user utility for the recommended items can be improved while reducing ad revenue by a small amount. This multiobjective approach, which unifies programmatic advertising and RS, opens a new frontier for advertising and RS research and we therefore provide an extended discussion of future research topics.},

In this mixed-methods study, we analyzed tracking logs from 25 graduate-level online courses (25 instructors and 341 students) and interviews from 10 instructors and 12 graduate students with diverse backgrounds. Findings suggest that all three conﬁgurations had their own advantages and disadvantages in fostering online discourse reading. However, our analysis suggests that the advantages of subgroup discussions in supporting note reading outweigh those of the Small and Large conﬁgurations. The overload effects in information reading due to large class sizes can be minimized by dividing students into small groups for discussion purposes. Group conﬁguration into proper-size groups may reduce students' reading loads. Interviewees felt that the waving of small groups into large classes beneﬁted their collaborative discussions. We conclude this paper with a list of pedagogical recommendations and new software features that may help group conﬁguration and enhance learning in online courses. This study may have implications for both practitioners and researchers to seek optimal group conﬁgurations to achieve more fruitful online discussions through note reading.},

  abstract = {Group-based conﬁguration systems support scenarios where a group of users conﬁgures a product/service. In those groupbased conﬁguration scenarios where the knowledge of some group members regarding items is insufﬁcient, an advice of experts is necessary in order to help members to evaluate products or services. This paper introduces a novel approach which takes advantage of the concept of liquid democracy that allows the delegation of group member votes to experts. Concerning the application of liquid democracy, we propose a new approach based on Multi-attribute Utility theory (MAUT)-based evaluation used to calculate the utility of conﬁgurable items. Compared to the traditional approach, the proposed MAUT-based evaluation focuses on the role of experts by assigning higher weights to them. Additionally, the respective expertise level of the experts is taken into account. Consequently, the main contribution of this paper consists in the improvement of group-based conﬁguration by taking liquid democracy aspects into consideration.},

In this paper, we survey approaches for diagnosing software conﬁguration errors, methods for debugging these errors, and techniques for testing against such issues. In addition, we outline current challenges of isolating and ﬁxing faults in conﬁguration settings, including improving fault localization, handling the case of multi-stack systems, and conﬁguration veriﬁcation at runtime.},

At ﬁrst glance, customization using conﬁgurators appears trivial; we simply select the conﬁguration options that we want. However, in practice, options are usually dependent on each other. Reasons for dependencies are manifold and are typically speciﬁc for the particular domain. Dependencies can be simple, such as one option requiring or excluding another option, but also arbitrarily complex, involving numerous options. In this study, we aim to understand how today’s web conﬁgurators support users in their decision making process. In particular, we are interested in understanding how conﬁgurators handle decisions that are in conﬂict with dependencies. To abstract from different visualizations, we classify the existing strategies of web conﬁgurators and discuss advantages and disadvantages of them. While we identiﬁed eight strategies, a single conﬁgurator typically uses several of those strategies.},

As traditional RM approaches require a deep involvement of the requirements managers of a RM project especially when it comes to assigning suitable stakeholders to requirements, the quality of the decisions and the time effort for making correct decisions mainly depends on these experts. In this paper, we present a novel stakeholder assignment approach that reduces the overall involvement of these experts and also limits the uncertainty of overseeing suitable stakeholders at the same time. The assignment of responsible stakeholders is represented as a group decision task expressed in the form of a basic conﬁguration problem. The outcome of such a task is a conﬁguration which is represented in terms of an assignment of responsible stakeholders to corresponding requirements.},

  abstract = {Abstract. 1 Product configurators have been accepted as an important enabling toolkit to bridge customer needs and company offerings. In the configuration process, customers choose from a set of predefined attributes and their options. The combination of choices forms the desired product configuration. It is observed that some online configurators provide default options for each attribute. Although previous studies show that the default option significantly affects customers’ choices during the product configuration process, it is not clear how other factors mediate this impact. In this paper, we investigate how product types, number of choices, customers’ degree of expertise, the importance of the attributes and the configuring sequence affect consumers’ decisions in the configuration process when default options are presented. Based on a series of empirical experiments, we find that customers’ degree of expertise, the rating of the attribute importance, and the number of attribute choices have a significant effect on customers’ choices for utilitarian products. For hedonic products, the importance of the attributes and the configuring sequence are significant factors.},
