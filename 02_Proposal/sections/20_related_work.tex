\section{Group-Based Configuration}
\label{sec:Related_Work:GroupBasedConfiguration}

In his thesis \citeauthor{raabKollaborativeProduktkonfigurationEchtzeit2019} built a collaborative configurator based on the CAS Merlin Configurator. Here groups of people are able to simultaneously configure a product. If there are any conflicts a conflict resolution process is started. However the prototype only allows a majority voting approach and does not provide any group decision support \cite{raabKollaborativeProduktkonfigurationEchtzeit2019}.

\section{Recommender Systems for Configuration}
\label{sec:Related_Work:RecommenderSystemsForGonfiguration}

\citeauthor{rubinshteynEntwicklungHybridenRecommender2018} looks at different approaches to recommendation and implements a prototype with CAS Merlin Configurator which uses a hybrid recommender system. His prototype combines constraint-based filtering with collaborative filtering \cite{rubinshteynEntwicklungHybridenRecommender2018}.
