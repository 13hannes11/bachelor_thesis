\section{Group-Based Configuration}
\label{sec:Related_Work:GroupBasedConfiguration}

One thesis done at CAS Software built a collaborative configurator based on the CAS Merlin Configurator. Here groups of people are able to simultaneously configure a product. If there are any conflicts a conflict resolution process is started. However the prototype only allows a majority voting approach and does not provide any group decision support \cite{raabKollaborativeProduktkonfigurationEchtzeit2019}.
