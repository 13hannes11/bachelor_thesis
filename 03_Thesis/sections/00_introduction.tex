\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:Introduction:Motivation}

Product configuration supports companies in their sales process, it reduces costs and decreases time needed to produce an offer for a product \cite{shafieeCostBenefitAnalysis2018}. Usually configuration is done by one user but for complex decisions the risk that a single user will make mistakes increases therefore making the decision in a group can yield better results \cite{felferningGroupBasedConfiguration2016, felfernigGroupDecisionSupport2011}. Unfortunately groups are not immune to group biases and group dynamics that can reduce the benefits of group decisions \cite{kerrBiasJudgmentComparing1996}.
There exists work on recommender systems for configuration and there are recommender systems for groups but there has not been any work on how to combine these. A recommender system, can help reduce influence of group behaviour and thereby increases the benefit of groups making more rational decisions than individuals \cite{charnessGroupsMakeBetter2012}.

\section{Research Question}
\label{sec:Introduction:ResearchQuestion}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can decision-making in group configuration processes be supported (through recommender systems)? (central question)
    \item Which requirements do configuration systems for collaborative decision-making have and how could such a system look like?
    \item How does group hierarchy and structure influence the decision-making process in group based configuration scenarios?
\end{enumerate}
