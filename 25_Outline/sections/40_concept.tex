\section{User Interaction with the System}
\label{sec:Concept:UserSystemInteraction}

The system has one main way to be used as defined in \autoref{tab:Concept:MainUseCase}.

\section{Solution Objectives}
\label{sec:Concept:SolutionObjectives}

Given an unfinished configuration and preferences of all group members rate a finished configuration on how well "similar" it reflects the configuration and preferences.

Use this to choose the best finished configuration out of a list to recommend.

\subsection{Generating a Recommendation}
\label{sec:Concept:GeneratingRecommendation}

Hereby the idea is there is a database of complete configurations (possibly historic from other groups or automatically generated or both).
Now the recommendation procedure looks as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assign a score to each stored configuration according to $$score_{group}(\overline{configurationState},\ \overline{preferences}, \ configurationInStore)$$
    \item Chose the configuration with the highest score as recommendation.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Benefits}
\label{sec:Concept:Benefits}

The benefits of this approach are, that the need for a group to communicate is reduced. Each user gives their own preferences and the group will get a recommendation based on that. This allows to reduce problems with communication of preferences and eliminates misunderstandings.
