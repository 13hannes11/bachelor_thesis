  abstract = {Recommender systems are personalized information access applications; they are ubiquitous in today's online environment, and effective at finding items that meet user needs and tastes. As the reach of recommender systems has extended, it has become apparent that the single-minded focus on the user common to academic research has obscured other important aspects of recommendation outcomes. Properties such as fairness, balance, profitability, and reciprocity are not captured by typical metrics for recommender system evaluation. The concept of multistakeholder recommendation has emerged as a unifying framework for describing and understanding recommendation settings where the end user is not the sole focus. This article describes the origins of multistakeholder recommendation, and the landscape of system designs. It provides illustrative examples of current research, as well as outlining open questions and research directions for the field.},

In those groupbased configuration scenarios where the knowledge of some group members regarding items is insufficient, an advice of experts is necessary in order to help members to evaluate products or services. This paper introduces a novel approach which takes advantage of the concept of liquid democracy that allows the delegation of group member votes to experts. Concerning the application of liquid democracy, we propose a new approach based on Multi-attribute Utility theory (MAUT)-based evaluation used to calculate the utility of configurable items. Compared to the traditional approach, the proposed MAUT-based evaluation focuses on the role of experts by assigning higher weights to them. Additionally, the respective expertise level of the experts is taken into account. Consequently, the main contribution of this paper consists in the improvement of group-based configuration by taking liquid democracy aspects into consideration.},

We analyzed the prediction quality of different aggregation functions by using data collected in a user study. The results indicate that those diagnoses guided by the Least Misery aggregation function achieve a higher prediction quality compared to the Average Voting, Most Pleasure, and Majority Voting. Moreover, another major outcome of our work reveals that diagnoses based on aggregation functions outperform basic approaches such as Breadth First Search and Direct Diagnosis.},

In an experimental study, three-person groups decided which of three candidates to select for a professorial appointment. We hypothesised that minority dissent in pre-discussion preferences improves the consideration of unshared information in groups and increases the discovery rate of hidden profiles. As predicted, consideration of unshared information increased with minority dissent. The expectation of an improvement of group decision quality was partially supported. In diversity groups (i.e. each member prefers a different alternative) consideration of unshared information and group decision quality was significantly higher than in simple minority groups. Results are discussed in the light of theories of minority influence. The benefits of using the hidden profile paradigm with minority and diversity groups for theory development in the area of group decision making are highlighted.

They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative \textcent{}ltering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative \textcent{}ltering.},

Using a consumption/saving laboratory experiment, we investigate behaviour in four treatments: (1) individual choice under risk; (2) group choice under risk; (3) individual choice under ambiguity and (4) group choice under ambiguity. Comparing decisions within and between decision environments, we find an anti-symmetric pattern. While individuals are choosing on average closer to the theoretical optimal predictions, compared to groups in the risk treatments, groups tend to deviate less under ambiguity. Within decision environments, individuals deviate more when they choose under ambiguity, while groups are better planners under ambiguity rather than under risk. Our results extend the often observed pattern of individuals (groups) behaving more optimally under risk (ambiguity), to its dynamic dimension.},

Contrary to the existing literature, team performance in both tasks is statistically indistinguishable from that of individuals when there is no cost to sending a message. If a tiny message cost is imposed, team performance improves and becomes statistically better than that of individuals, although still worse than previous research on teams would have suggested. Message costs reduce the quantity of messages but increase the quality, specifically the mix of good and bad suggestions. The improved quality of communication with message costs allows teams to outperform individuals.},

We first describe the design process behind a set of dynamic emoticons, which we call empatheticons. We then show that they allow users to represent, annotate, and visualize group members' emotions in GroupFun, a group music recommender. An in-depth user study (N = 18) with GroupFun demonstrates that users' emotion annotation for recommended songs can be influenced by other group members. Most importantly, empatheticons enhance users' perceptions of the connectedness (immediacy) and familiarity (intimacy) with each other and the positive group dynamics.},

However, the usefulness of each rating may vary significantly, i.e., different ratings may bring a different amount and type of information about the user's tastes. Hence, specific techniques, which are defined as ``active learning strategies'', can be used to selectively choose the items to be presented to the user for rating. In fact, an active learning strategy identifies and adopts criteria for obtaining data that better reflects users' preferences and enables to generate better recommendations.},

In contrast to an explicit definition of each individual item, configurable products such as computers, financial service portfolios, and cars are represented in the form of a configuration knowledge base that describes the properties of allowed instances. Although the knowledge representation used is different compared to non-configurable products, the decision support requirements remain the same: users have to be supported in finding a solution that fits their wishes and needs. In this paper we show how recommendation technologies can be applied for supporting the configuration of products. In addition to existing approaches we discuss relevant issues for future research.},

Nevertheless, at present, they have been evaluated in many, often incompatible, ways. We affirm this problem is mainly due to the lack of a common framework for recommender systems, a framework general enough so that we may include the whole range of recommender systems to date, but specific enough so that we can obtain solid results. In this paper, we propose such a framework, attempting to extract the essential features of recommender systems. In this framework, the most essential feature is the objective of the recommender system. What is more, in this paper, recommender systems are viewed as applications with the following essential objective. Recommender systems must: (i) choose which (of the items) should be shown to the user, (ii) decide when and how the recommendations must be shown. Next, we will show that a new metric emerges naturally from this framework. Finally, we will conclude by comparing the properties of this new metric with the traditional ones. Among other things, we will show that we may evaluate the whole range of recommender systems with this single metric.},

  abstract = {The group decision-making framework with linguistic preference relations is studied. In this context, we assume that there exist several experts who may have different background and knowledge to solve a particular problem and, therefore, different linguistic term sets (multigranular linguistic information) could be used to express their opinions. The aim of this paper is to present a model of consensus support system to assist the experts in all phases of the consensus reaching process of group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations. This consensus support system model is based on i) a multigranular linguistic methodology, ii) two consensus criteria, consensus degrees and proximity measures, and iii) a guidance advice system. The multigranular linguistic methodology permits the unification of the different linguistic domains to facilitate the calculus of consensus degrees and proximity measures on the basis of experts' opinions. The consensus degrees assess the agreement amongst all the experts' opinions, while the proximity measures are used to find out how far the individual opinions are from the group opinion. The guidance advice system integrated in the consensus support system model acts as a feedback mechanism, and it is based on a set of advice rules to help the experts change their opinions and to find out which direction that change should follow in order to obtain the highest degree of consensus possible. There are two main advantages provided by this model of consensus support system. Firstly, its ability to cope with group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations, and, secondly, the figure of the moderator, traditionally presents in the consensus reaching process, is replaced by the guidance advice system, and in such a way, the whole group decision-making process is automated.},

In design science research (DSR), research questions are important to define the scope and the modes of inquiry, characterize the artifacts, and communicate the contributions. Despite the importance of research questions, there are few guidelines on how to construct suitable DSR research questions. We fill this gap by exploring ways of constructing DSR research questions and analyzing the research questions in a sample of 104 DSR publications. The results show that about two thirds of the analyzed DSR publications actually use research questions to link their problem statements to research approaches and that most of the questions are aimed at problem-solving. Based on our analysis, we derive a typology of DSR question formulation to provide guidelines and patterns that help researchers formulate research questions during their DSR projects' duration.},

To address the specific issues, we propose the Comprehensive Group Similarity Preference Aggregation (CGSPA) algorithm for Group Itinerary Recommendation System implemented in this paper. CGSPA comprehensively considers three aspects to aggregate group preference requirement, which are (1) the average maximum similarity between the recommendation plan and group preference; (2) the difference between the similarity of each session in the recommendation plan and the corresponding preference needs of the user group; (3) the historical similarity between the recommendation plan and group preference. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the preference aggregation performance and the robustness of CGSPA algorithm. We conclude that with different group scales, CGSPA's group average satisfaction score is higher compared to the traditional preference aggregation algorithms.},

The platform selects sponsored items to maximize ad revenue, often through some form of programmatic auction, and non-sponsored items to maximize user utility with a recommender system (RS). We develop a multiobjective binary integer programming model to allocate sponsored recommendations considering a dual objective of maximizing ad revenue and user utility. We propose an algorithm to solve it in a computationally efficient way. Our method can be applied as a form of post processing to an existing RS, making it widely applicable. We apply the model to data from an online grocery retailer and show that user utility for the recommended items can be improved while reducing ad revenue by a small amount. This multiobjective approach, which unifies programmatic advertising and RS, opens a new frontier for advertising and RS research and we therefore provide an extended discussion of future research topics.},

This activity is critical in the sense that careless feature selections might lead to undesirable products. Even though product configuration is seen as a team activity in which divergent interests and views are merged into a single consistent product specification, current configuration technology is essentially single-userbased. This configuration approach can be error-prone and time-consuming as it usually requires numerous interactions between the product manager and the stakeholders to resolve decision conflicts. To tackle this problem we have proposed an approach called ``Collaborative Product Configuration'' (CPC). In this paper, we extend the CPC approach by providing efficient dependency analysis algorithms to support the validation of workflow-based descriptions called CPC plans. In addition, we add to previous work by providing a formal description of the approach's concepts, an augmented illustrated example, and a discussion covering several prototype tools now available.},

For a risky choice problem, a similar framing effect was observed for groups and individuals. For an intertemporal choice task where consumption was either delayed or accelerated, na\"ive groups (whose members had not preconsidered the decision) showed a framing effect, less discounting in the delay frame, opposite to that observed in individuals. Predecided groups showed a non-significant effect in the other, expected direction. In all cases, process measures better explained variability in choices across conditions than frame alone. Implications for group decision research and design considerations for committee decisions are addressed.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract = {Today's competitive marketplace requires the industry to understand unique and particular needs of their customers. Product line practices enable companies to create individual products for every customer by providing an interdependent set of features. Users configure personalized products by consecutively selecting desired features based on their individual needs. However, as most features are interdependent, users must understand the impact of their gradual selections in order to make valid decisions. Thus, especially when dealing with large feature models, specialized assistance is needed to guide the users in configuring their product. Recently, recommender systems have proved to be an appropriate mean to assist users in finding information and making decisions. In this paper, we propose an advanced feature recommender system that provides personalized recommendations to users. In detail, we offer four main contributions: (i) We provide a recommender system that suggests relevant features to ease the decision-making process. (ii) Based on this system, we provide visual support to users that guides them through the decision-making process and allows them to focus on valid and relevant parts of the configuration space. (iii) We provide an interactive open-source configurator tool encompassing all those features. (iv) In order to demonstrate the performance of our approach, we compare three different recommender algorithms in two real case studies derived from business experience.},

However, not many studies have examined the influence of group configuration on online discourse note reading. The current study examined note reading workloads and participants' perceptions of the three group configurations (large whole class, small whole class, large with subgroups) in online graduate-level courses from one institute. In this mixed-methods study, we analyzed tracking logs from 25 graduate-level online courses (25 instructors and 341 students) and interviews from 10 instructors and 12 graduate students with diverse backgrounds. Findings suggest that all three configurations had their own advantages and disadvantages in fostering online discourse reading. However, our analysis suggests that the advantages of subgroup discussions in supporting note reading outweigh those of the Small and Large configurations. The overload effects in information reading due to large class sizes can be minimized by dividing students into small groups for discussion purposes. Group configuration into proper-size groups may reduce students' reading loads. Interviewees felt that the waving of small groups into large classes benefited their collaborative discussions. We conclude this paper with a list of pedagogical recommendations and new software features that may help group configuration and enhance learning in online courses. This study may have implications for both practitioners and researchers to seek optimal group configurations to achieve more fruitful online discussions through note reading.},

In this paper, we present a novel stakeholder assignment approach that reduces the overall involvement of these experts and also limits the uncertainty of overseeing suitable stakeholders at the same time. The assignment of responsible stakeholders is represented as a group decision task expressed in the form of a basic configuration problem. The outcome of such a task is a configuration which is represented in terms of an assignment of responsible stakeholders to corresponding requirements.},

A biased search for information supporting the group's favored alternative impairs a group's ability to fulfill these requirements. In a two-factorial experiment with 201 employees and managers from various economic and public organizations, genuine and contrived dissent were investigated as counterstrategies to biased information seeking. Genuine dissent was manipulated by forming three-person groups whose members either all favored the same alternative individually (homogeneous groups) or consisted of a minority and a majority faction with regard to their favored alternative (heterogeneous groups). Contrived dissent was varied by the use or nonuse of the ``devil's advocacy'' technique. The results demonstrate that heterogeneity was more effective in preventing a confirmatory information-seeking bias than devil's advocacy was. Confidence was identified as an important mediator. Implications for the design of interventions aimed at facilitating reality testing in group decision making are discussed. \'O 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

In this paper we analyze anchoring effects as a specific type of decision bias in the context of group decision scenarios. On the basis of the results of a user study in the domain of software requirements prioritization we discuss results regarding the optimal time when preference information of other users should be disclosed to the current user. Furthermore, we show that explanations can increase the satisfaction of group members with various aspects of a group decision process (e.g., satisfaction with the decision and decision support quality).},

  abstract = {Customization is omnipresent in our everyday live. There are web configurators to customize cars, trucks, bikes, computers, clothes, furniture, and food. At first glance, customization using configurators appears trivial; we simply select the configuration options that we want. However, in practice, options are usually dependent on each other. Reasons for dependencies are manifold and are typically specific for the particular domain. Dependencies can be simple, such as one option requiring or excluding another option, but also arbitrarily complex, involving numerous options. In this study, we aim to understand how today's web configurators support users in their decision making process. In particular, we are interested in understanding how configurators handle decisions that are in conflict with dependencies. To abstract from different visualizations, we classify the existing strategies of web configurators and discuss advantages and disadvantages of them. While we identified eight strategies, a single configurator typically uses several of those strategies.},

A major side-effect for companies providing complex products and services is that customers quite often get confused by the high variety and do not make a purchase. Personalization technologies can help to alleviate the challenges of mass customization. These technologies support customers in specifying products and services that fit their wishes and needs in a fashion where decision and interaction efforts with sales support systems are significantly reduced. We provide a short overview of related research and the articles that are part of this special issue on Personalization and Mass Customization.},

Thus far research has been unable to identify the process responsible for this effect. In the present study, we propose that group members' task representations mediate the effect of knowledge about the distribution of information on decision performance. Building on this proposition, we also propose that reflection about the task moderates the effect of knowledge about distributed information through its effect on task representations. These hypotheses were put to the test in an experimental study of decision-making groups (N = 125). As predicted, knowledge of distributed information interacted with reflection to affect decision quality. Findings confirmed the proposed mediating role of task representations and information elaboration.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, companies have moved from offering a single product for all their clients, to offer different customized for each one. These companies provide Configuration Systems where a user can decide and discard which features she wants in her final product. However, although almost all of these systems support individual decisions, usually they do not offer an special support for decisions made by multiple users for the same product. This paper introduces Multi-SPLOT, a web-based Configuration System that supports simultaneous decisions from multiple users. This system uses off-the-shelf solvers to determine if these decisions are not conflicting among them, and to propose solutions when the decisions of an user conflict with decisions of the others. This paper shows the design of the solution and details of its implementation using Angular, Firebase and the optimization library in Google App Script.},

  abstract = {Abstract. 1 Product configurators have been accepted as an important enabling toolkit to bridge customer needs and company offerings. In the configuration process, customers choose from a set of predefined attributes and their options. The combination of choices forms the desired product configuration. It is observed that some online configurators provide default options for each attribute. Although previous studies show that the default option significantly affects customers' choices during the product configuration process, it is not clear how other factors mediate this impact. In this paper, we investigate how product types, number of choices, customers' degree of expertise, the importance of the attributes and the configuring sequence affect consumers' decisions in the configuration process when default options are presented. Based on a series of empirical experiments, we find that customers' degree of expertise, the rating of the attribute importance, and the number of attribute choices have a significant effect on customers' choices for utilitarian products. For hedonic products, the importance of the attributes and the configuring sequence are significant factors.},
