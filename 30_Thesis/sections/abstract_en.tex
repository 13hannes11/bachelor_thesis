\Abstract

Group-based configuration is a rather new configuration approach. It presents a scenario where a group is configuring a product, service or solution. However, good group decisions are difficult to make. Therefore, to make decisions in groups easier, group recommender systems exist. Yet, they have not been applied to group-based configuration. This thesis proposes a concept for a recommender system that helps a group to find a consensus for a configuration decision. The concept is evaluated with synthetically generated groups of four people and shows good results for heterogeneous groups.
