\section{Further Research}
\label{sec:Conclusion:PossibleExtensions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How to optimise such that no need to search through all stored finished configurations is necessary? (e.g. improve runtime from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(log\ n)$)
    \item How to model hierarchy and knowledge about product components in preferences?
    \item Letting users set preferences for product functions (e.g. for a forest a recreation function, a productive function, a protective function, etc.). How does it compare to explicitly choosing preferences?
    \item Does the assumption that the closer the configuration state is to a finished configuration, the less the satisfaction increase and the less difference among recommended configurations hold true?
    \item Validating if satisfaction correlates with theoretical metric used in this thesis
\end{itemize}
