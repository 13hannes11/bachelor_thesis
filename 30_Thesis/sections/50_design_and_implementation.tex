\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{ch:DesignImplementation}

This thesis requires a group configuration system with a recommender. In this thesis a modified version of \emph{CAS Configurator Merlin} \cite{IndustrySpecificProduct2020} is used that has been developed by \citeauthor{raabKollaborativeProduktkonfigurationEchtzeit2019} \cite{raabKollaborativeProduktkonfigurationEchtzeit2019}. The base system is described in \autoref{sec:Foundations:BaseSystem}.

For this thesis \texttt{M.Collab} and \texttt{M.Collab-Customer} have undergone some slight modifications to allow the displaying of recommendations and to query the recommender. The user interface is shown in \autoref{fig:DesignImplementation:UserInterface}. It is extended by adding a preference slider that works in the interval $[0,1]$. The user receives feedback on what a value means based on the thumb position. The thumb rotates from thumbs-down to neutral to thumbs-up based on the selected value. Also functionality to show other participants in the session was added.

\section{Microservice}
\label{sec:DesignImplementation:Microservice}

An existing base system can be extended in different directions. As \texttt{M.Collab} already functions as middleman between \texttt{M.Collab-Customer} and \texttt{M.Core} , one solution would be to add recommender functionality to \texttt{M.Collab-Customer}. However, this approach would conflict with the \emph{single responsibility} \cite{martinCleanArchitectureCraftsman2017} and \emph{separation of concern} \cite{de2002importance} software design principles. It would change \texttt{M.Collab} from a system that works similar to a router to one that additionally handles  recommendations. \texttt{M.Collab} manages communication between \texttt{M.Collab-Customer} instances and between \texttt{M.Core} and \texttt{M.Collab-Customer}. Thus this solution was discarded.

Another viable solution is adding the recommendation functionality to \texttt{M.Core}. The main benefit of this approach is that it allows the recommender to use systems that are used for solving constraint satisfaction problems to enhance recommendations. The disadvantage of this approach is, however, that now the recommender is tightly coupled with the configurator. Not only does this mean that reproducing results in this thesis is only possible with access to a non-open-source product but it also means that there is no possibility to use the recommender for other configuration solutions. Moreover, no plugin API exists and, as a result the extension would require a large effort.

Components that have a grey background are added and components with a partial grey background undergo changes.}

\end{figure}

Due to these reasons it was decided to create a new microservice (see \autoref{fig:DesignImplementation:RecommenderForCollaborativeConfiguratorMerlin}), called \texttt{M.Recommend} which communicates with \texttt{M.Collab}, and thereby it is loosely coupled with other system components. Additionally, this approach allows to add functionality that takes  advantage of a constraint satisfaction problem solver by either communicating with one via an API or by integrating one directly into the recommender component \texttt{M.Recommend}. Moreover, it also allows the use of different technologies instead of JavaScript and Node.js. Using a separate component also allows to scale the system differently as it is possible to use multiple recommender instances for one configurator instance or one recommender instance with multiple configurator instances. This is an advantage in the age of automatically scaling systems.


\section{API}
\label{sec:DesignImplementation:API}

The API used for the recommender is a REST-API. REST allows the flexible addition of new endpoints thereby making the system easy to extend.
When a recommendation is supposed to be generated, \texttt{M.Collab} sends a HTTP-POST-request to M.Recommend (see \autoref{fig:DesignImplementation:SequenceDiagramRecommendation}). This request contains preferences and the current configuration. \texttt{M.Recommend} generates a recommendation based on the received data as a response. The recommended finished configuration is now sent from  \texttt{M.Collab} via broadcast over WebSockets to all M.Customer clients. 

\begin{figure}[b]

    \caption[Sequence Diagram: Recommendation Generation]{A sequence diagram showing the recommendation process.}
    \label{fig:DesignImplementation:SequenceDiagramRecommendation}
\end{figure}

The REST API defines the following Endpoints.

\begin{description}
    \item[/recommender/] is reachable via a POST request and accepts a configuration state and preferences. Based on that a finished configuration is sent back as response.
    \item[/config/] accepts GET and POST requests. Sending a GET request results in a list of all stored configurations being sent back. POST is used for adding a finished configuration to the configuration database.
    \item[/product\_structure/] is reachable via GET and PUT. GET returns the current product structure and PUT is there to replace it.
\end{description}

The API is implemented with a minimal amount of functions and the recommender currently only supports one product at a time. However, the architecture is built in a way that it can be easily extended into supporting multiple products.
The general architecture adheres to a \emph{model-view-controller} \cite{gamma2015design} inspired architecture.
Data is stored and retrieved using \emph{data access objects}. Therefore, the currently used simple TinyDB database backend can be replaced with a different one easily.

\section{Database}
\label{sec:DesignImplementation:Database}

The choice among database systems has to be made between \emph{non-relational} and \emph{relational} databases. Relational databases are good in regard to at the four ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) principles \cite{chrysanthis1998recovery, cookACIDBASEDatabase2009}. Moreover, if the data structures are not changing it provides a solid basis that keeps the data reliable. A non-relational database on the other hand is ideal for rapid agile development. Besides, it excels if data requirements are not entirely clear and if a large amount of unstructured  data has to be stored. Furthermore, non-relational databases allow the system to store the data in any kind of structure. This proves an advantage as it allows to use the same data structure to be stored that also has to be fed out through the api. Hence, parsing methods for the API can be reused and altered upon changing requirements. Moreover, the data used for the recommender is mostly not interconnected. Therefore a relational databases' main strength, the data structure, does not really come into play here. Thus, in this thesis a non-relational database is used. 

\section{Scoring Functions}
\label{sec:DesignImplementation:ScroingFunctions}

\begin{figure}[tb]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./figures/50_design_and_implementation/class_diagram_scoring_functions_simplified.pdf}
    \caption[Class Diagram: Scoring Functions]{A simplified class diagram of the classes and interface related to scoring functions. }
    \label{fig:DesignImplementation:ClassDiagramScoringFunctions}
\end{figure}

This section describes the implementation of scoring functions (see \autoref{fig:DesignImplementation:ClassDiagramScoringFunctions}) which are implemented in a modular fashion. There are different types of scoring functions. Some are meant for evaluating user preferences (and inherit from the class \texttt{PreferenceScoringFunction}), others are meant for penalising changes in the current configuration state and therefore inherit from  \texttt{ConfigurationPenalty}. The last type of scoring function is \texttt{ReduceScoringFunction} that consists of one or multiple scoring functions and combines their scores to one. It uses the \emph{composite design pattern} \cite{gamma2015design}. These functions allow Â´the flexible combination of functions and, in addition due to their underlying structure they can use similar components. For example, preference scoring functions use a \emph{pipeline} \cite{gamma2015design} to first convert preferences to a list of values. This is done using \texttt{PreferenceToListFunction}. A list can be modified with a \texttt{ListToListFunction}. This step is optional. The last mandatory step is to convert the list to a value using \texttt{ListToValueFunction}. After this step, the value can be modified further, for example with a threshold function or any other function. All these components allow the easy and quick creation of new scoring functions. A factory (\texttt{ScoringFunctionFactory}) is used to assemble a scoring function based on input parameters. This provides flexibility for quickly implementing new types of scoring functions.

\section{Technologies}
\label{sec:DesignImplementation:Technologies}

\texttt{M.Recommend} is built in \emph{Python} \cite{PythonOrg} using \emph{FlaskRESTPlus} \cite{FlaskRESTPlus13Documentation}. \emph{FlaskRESTPlus} is an extension of \emph{Flask} \cite{FlaskDocumentation} that is meant to build a REST-Service and allows the generation of a web UI which documents the API. \emph{Flask} is a WSGI \cite{WhatWSGI} framework that is meant to easily get started with development while maintaining the ability to scale up to complex applications.

As Database system \emph{TinyDB} \cite{TinyDB15Documentation} with the extension \emph{tinyrecord} \cite{junEugeneeeoTinyrecord2020} is being employed. \emph{TinyDB} is a simple well tested NoSQL database framework that can store documents that are represented as dictionaries. The extension \emph{tinyrecord} adds atomic transaction support with a record-first then execute architecture.

As testing library for unit tests \emph{pytest} \cite{PytestDocumentation} is being employed which is commonly used for python. It supports automatic test discovery.

For the evaluation of data and also for some operations with lists \emph{numpy} \cite{NumPy} is being employed. This library is optimised for fast scientific computing. 

Visualisation is done using \emph{Matplotlib} \cite{MatplotlibDocumentation} in combination with \emph{pandas} \cite{PandasPythonData}. \emph{Pandas} is a powerful framework for data analysis and data manipulation which in the context of this thesis is being employed to load evaluation data.


\section{Requirements Assessment}
\label{sec:DesignImplementation:RequirementsAssesment}

The requirements posed in \autoref{sec:Concept:Requirements} are assessed in this section. The recommender uses a continuous value range between zero and one for preferences. Additionally, the recommendation component is designed to be used independently, therefore it is possible to use it without proprietary software.
Additionally, the group scoring function takes into account preferences of each group member and the current configuration state. The recommendation system can be used by multiple users at the same time as all information needed for a recommendation is sent with the recommendation request. Accordingly, multiple group configurators can use the system at the same time. Furthermore, only valid solutions are recommended because the recommender system's configuration database stores finished configurations. Moreover, the system responds in a timely manner with all components running on the same machine, a modern laptop.
Consequently, all mandatory requirements have been fulfilled.

The user interface is simple because a user only has two possible opportunities for action. They can change their preferences with a slider or change the configuration state. Additionally, the system is made to be compatible with other configuration systems. These have to implement the correct API-calls. However, this requirement was not tested with a different configuration system. Different scoring functions can be used however they can neither be selected through user interface nor through the API. Thus, this requirement is only partially fulfilled but the system allows extension to fulfil this requirement fully.
Overall optional requirements have been addressed but they have not been thoroughly evaluated and some of them have only been partially implemented.
