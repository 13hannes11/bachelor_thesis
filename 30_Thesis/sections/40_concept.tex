\section{Foundations Extension}
\label{sec:Concept:Requirements}

The definitions described in \autoref{ch:Foundations} need to be extended for this thesis. This section adds definitions that are needed.

\subsection{Configuration State}

A \emph{configuration} $S$ will be defined as a tuple of variables (\autoref{eq:Foundations:ProductConfiguration:Variables}) and their corresponding domain value with
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Foundations:ProductConfiguration:ConfigurationState}
    S = \{ (v_i,\ d) \ |\ v_i \in V \ \land \ d \in \mathfrak{D}(i),\ i=1,\dotsc,m \}.
\end{equation}
Essentially it is a set of variables and assigned values.

\subsection{Finished Configuration}
To define what a \emph{finished configuration} is, it is required to first define what it means for a configuration to be valid. Therefore $is\_valid$ is defined as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Foundations:ProductConfiguration:IsValid}
    is\_valid : S \to \{true, false\}; x \mapsto 
    \begin{cases}
        true, & S \in solution\_space \\
        false, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases},
\end{equation}
with $solution\_space$ being the solution space of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem. A \emph{finished configuration} $S_F$ is a configuration that contains all variables and is a valid configuration:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Foundations:ProductConfiguration:FinishedConfiguration}
    S_F \subset S,\ where \ \forall v_i \in V (\exists (v_i, d) \in S_F : d \in \mathfrak{D}(i)) \land is\_valid(S_F).
\end{equation}
In practice a finished configuration of a product is something that is ready to be produced. For example if a car is being configured, this means that the car can be produced in the specified way that is given by the finished configuration.


\subsection{Group-Based Product Configuration}
\label{sec:Foundations:GroupBasedProductConfiguration}

Instead of a single person configuring a product, a group of people is configuring one product which can be useful in multi-stakeholder decisions. This setting needs mechanisms for describing the preferences of multiple people. Therefore there will be introduced a set of users $U$ with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Foundations:ProductConfiguration:Users}
    U = \{1, \dotsc, n\},
\end{equation}
and a user's \emph{utility function} that maps a domain value to a utility value and is only known to the user
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        u_i(d_j), \qquad \text{where}\ & u_i(d_j) \in [0,1] \\
        & d_j \in  \mathfrak{D}(j),\\
        & 1 <= j <= m, \\
        & 1 <= i <= n.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Group Recommender}

For a group recommender system additional definitions are needed. The attitude of a user is represented by their preferences $P$ which is directly related to the utility a user has from a domain value being present in the configuration. Let 
\begin{gather} \label{tab:Foundations:GroupRecommenderSystem:Preferences}
    P = \{ P_1, \dotsc, P_n\},\ \text{where} \\
    P_i = \{(d,\ u_i(d)) \ | \ \forall d \in \mathfrak{D}(i),\ i=1,\dotsc,m \} \notag
\end{gather}


\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:Concept:Requirements}

This section lists requirements that are considered and implemented in this thesis by the group-based configurator, including the recommendation system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mandatory:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The recommender should support a continuous value range for preferences
            \item The recommendation engine can be used without proprietary software.
            \item Give recommendations to a group, based on their preferences and the current configuration state.
            \item The system supports multiple group configurators at the same time.
            \item The system should take the current configuration state into account.

            \item Recommendations should always be valid solutions.
            \item They system has to respond in a timely manner.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Optional:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Have a simple user interface.
            \item The system should be able to work with other configuration systems.
            \item Recommendations should allow different scoring functions.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:Concept:Assumptions}

Due to a thesis having limited resources, some assumptions have to be made. The assumptions made are listed in this section.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only one product/solution is supposed to be configured at the same time by one group.
    \item Features only support single value attributes.
    \item Users join the system and start configuring only after all group members have joined.
    \item Speed and optimization of the system is not a high priority.
    \item The user interface is for demoing purposes.
\end{itemize}

Only supporting one product to be configured at a time by a group and the assumption that only single value attributes are supported is made to reduce complexity. Therefore less implementation work is needed. However, results are not dependent on these implementations. Most features use only single value attributes. Also it is possible to model a feature that supports multiple attributes. As an example the feature \emph{audio system} has the following options \emph{Bluetooth} or \emph{CD}. To allow multiple attributes to be selected the characteristic \emph{Bluetooth and CD} can be added.
The assumption that users join the system and only start configuring once all members of the group joined is made to reduce the amount of work needed for creating a lobby and waiting system which is not relevant for showing the functionality of the recommender. Speed and optimization of the system are not of high priority as the speed has no influence on the results of this thesis. Therefore as long as the system is fast enough, no further optimisation of speed is needed.
The evaluation is done solely with the recommender system and its APIs therefore the user interface is not directly relevant for the evaluation but it is relevant for communication of results.

\section{User Interaction with the System}
\label{sec:Concept:UserSystemInteraction}

The system has one main way to be used as defined in \autoref{tab:Concept:MainUseCase}. This process is also visualized in \autoref{fig:Concept:ConfigurationProcess}.
hier braucht es noch eine genauere textliche Beschreibung, was in der Grafik zu sehen ist. Auch: woher kommt diese Prozessdefinition? Wurde sie aus den Requirements und Einschränkungen abgeleitet?

The used characteristics and attributes are shown in \autoref{fig:Concept:ForestExample}. Additionally as example are given preferences, a configuration state and a finished configuration.

\section{Solution Generation}
\label{sec:Concept:SolutionGeneration}

\todo[inline]{hier wird erstmal nicht klar, worum es geht. 
The process of finding a suitable configuration to recommend, the following steps are executed: ...
oder auf was will der Absatz hinaus?}

Given an unfinished configuration and preferences of all group members, rate a finished configuration on how well it reflects the configuration state and preferences. Use this to choose the best finished configuration out of a list to recommend. This approach is an aggregated preference strategy of ranking of candidate items (see \autoref{sec:Foundations:GroupRecommenderSystem}).

\subsection{Generating a Recommendation}

\todo[inline]{den prozess noch ein bisschen erklären: was bezieht der Score mit ein? Warum anschließend bestimmte Konfigurationen ausschließen? Warum dafür eine neue Bewertungsfunktion? Warum ist dieser Schritt optional? Was bedeutet es dann, wenn eine Konfiguration ausgesucht wurde?}

There is a database of complete configurations (possibly historic from other groups or automatically generated or both).
Now the recommendation procedure looks as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assign a score to each stored configuration according to $$score_{group}(\overline{configurationState},\ \overline{preferences}, \ configurationInStore)$$
    \item Chose the configuration with the highest score as recommendation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scoring Function}
\label{subsec:Concept:SolutionGeneration:ScoringFunction}

\emph{Group configuration scoring function} includes preferences and current configuration state. This function gives a score for a finished configuration (while using the current configuration state and all user preferences):
\begin{equation}
    score_{group}: S \times P \times S_F \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}

An example group configuration scoring function is $score_{group}$ with \todo[]{erkläre die Formel, es bleibt offen, wie über die Nutzer aggregiert wird}
\begin{equation}
    score_{group}(\overline{s},\ \overline{p},\ s) = score(\overline{p},\ s) \cdot penalty(\overline{s},\ s)
\end{equation} 

This thesis will use multiple scoring functions. Among those are ones for least misery, average and multiplicative which all are implemented by $score$ \todo[]{Referenz zur Stelle, wo die verwendeten Funktionen im Detail beschrieben werden}. Average and multiplicative yield good results among the studies presented by \citeauthor{Masthoff2015} \cite{Masthoff2015}. Strategies can also be combined, one example here is average without misery. The scoring functions used for this thesis all combine $penalty$ and $score$ by multiplication. However it is possible to use other combination strategies and it is possible to combine multiple scoring functions into one group scoring function. This thesis will use simpler scoring functions that are not combined but improvement here is possible.

\subsubsection{Preference Scoring}

All of the aggregation functions mentioned in \autoref{subsec:Concept:SolutionGeneration:ScoringFunction} have one preference per product. For configuration where a preference for all characterises exists there needs to be a function that combines the preferences of one user into her configuration score. After one score has been calculated per user the mentioned preference aggregation strategies can be used.

A simple scoring function approach is to use the the preference for each characteristic that is part of the configuration and then use the average. This approach is transparent because the preference of a user is directly translated into the score and no weighting is done. It means that a configuration score is simple to understand and to calculate. However, if needed, for example, to give one group member more power, it allows relative weighting. This can be done with preprocessing of preferences. Moreover, an approach like this ensures that through preprocessing feature weights can be added. It is therefore possible that a user gives different importances to features. Also, other means of weighting ratings are possible. For example the ratings of one group member who has more knowledge in an area can be increased by multiplication with a factor or alternatively the preferences for all other users can be decreased.
The formula for this rating function looks as follows:

\begin{equation}
    score(\overline{p},\ s) = aggr( \ \{score_{user}(P_i, s) \ | \ P_i \in \overline{p} \} \ )
\end{equation}
where $aggr$ the aggregation function and $score_{user}(P_i, s)$ the configuration score of user $i$ which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    score_{user}(P_i, s) = average(\{x \ | \ (characteristic, x) \in P_i \land characteristic \in s \}) \notag . 
\end{equation}

The example in \autoref{fig:Concept:ForestExample} contains two users. The first user has preferences for the characteristic \emph{manual} of the feature with $0.8$ and the characteristic \emph{harvester} of the same feature with $0.3$. All other characteristics have a preference of $0.5$. The second user's preferences are $0.5$ for all characteristics. The finished configuration that is supposed to be rated in this example contains the characteristics \emph{low} for each feature except for \emph{effort} and \emph{quantity} which are set to \emph{manual} and \emph{high}. The score fore the finished configuration $S_F$ of user one is $0.54$. This score is the average of all seven features. User one rates all characteristics of all features as $0.5$ except two characteristics for \emph{effort}. Therefore all, feature scores for this user are $0.5$ except the score for \emph{effort} is $0.8$ because of the user's preference of $0.8$ for the characteristic \emph{manual}. The resulting average score per feature of $0.54$ is the user's score for this configuration. User two rates all characteristics with $0.5$ therefore the resulting average is $0.5$.
The group configuration score is dependent on the used aggregation strategy. Multiplication results in a score of $0.54 \cdot 0.5 = 0.27$. The score for average is $\frac{1}{2}(0.54 + 0.5) = 0.52$ and for least misery $\min \{0.54, 0.5\} = 0.5$.

\subsubsection{Cofiguration Change Penalty}
\label{subsubsec:Concept:SolutionGeneration:ScoringFunction:Penalty}

In this thesis a penalty function is proposed which gives the percentage of characteristics that exist in the configuration that is to be rated. This value can be tuned to be more or less strict by potentiating. This is done by selection different values for $\alpha$. Thereby allowing more deviation or less deviation from the current configuration state. The penalty function is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \notag \alpha \in \mathbb{R}, \qquad     unchanged(d,\overline{s}, s) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1, & d \in \overline{s} \land d \in s \\
      0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    penalty_{proportion}(\overline{s},\ s) =  \left(\frac{\sum_{d \in \overline{s}} unchanged(d,\overline{s}, s)}{|\overline{s}|}\right)^\alpha.
\end{equation}
In essence the the function checks the number of unchanged characteristics and divides this by the number of characteristics that are in the current configuration state. The result is the proportion of unchanged characteristics when comparing the current configuration state to the finished configuration.

By including the current configuration state, the scoring function can take into account that some characteristics have already been realized and therefore might be very costly to change. A higher $\alpha$ resembles a higher cost of change and an alpha of zero represents no costs for changes.

\section{Illustration}
\label{sec:Concept:Illustration}

This section gives an example to illustrate how the recommendation works. The example in \autoref{fig:Concept:ForestExample} is used for that but the preferences are extended. \autoref{tab:Concept:UseCaseConfigurations} shows the current configuration state which consists of the characteristic moderate for the feature \textit{indigenous} and  \textit{resilient} respectively. $S_{F1}$ to $S_{F4}$ show the stored configurations for this example. The features that will be focused on are \textit{indigenous}, \textit{resilient} and \textit{effort}. In the presented example $S_{F1}$ performs best. The exact reason for that will be presented here. $S_{F1}$ is compared to $S_{F2}$ to show the effect of divergence from the configuration state.  A comparison between $S_{F1}$  and $S_{F3}$ is done to show the difference between preferences and the effect on the score and last, $S_{F4}$ is done to show the effect of switching to better preferences but diverging from the current state. The configurations all differ to $S_{F1}$ in only one characteristic that is chosen differently. As aggregation strategy the \emph{average} metric is used (see \autoref{sec:Foundations:GroupRecommenderSystem}). The parameter $\alpha$ (see \autoref{subsubsec:Concept:SolutionGeneration:ScoringFunction:Penalty}) is set to 1. A lower $\alpha$ reduces the penalty given to configurations that deviate from the configuration state $S$ and a higher $\alpha$ increase the reluctance to change.

The difference between  $S_{F1}$ and  $S_{F2}$ is that instead of containing \emph{moderate} for the feature \emph{resilient} $S_{F2}$ contains \emph{high}. The scores for these two characteristics are the same, with a value of $0.55$,as both users have rated them at $0.5$ but as $S_{F2}$ deviates from the configuration state there will be a penalty. There are two characteristics in the configuration state $S$ therefore the the penalty is $(\frac{1}{2})^\alpha = (\frac{1}{2})^1 = 0.5$. This means the score of $S_{F2}$ is half that of $S_{F1}$. Resulting in a final score of $0.275$ compared to $0.55$.

The only difference between $S_{F1}$ and $S_{F3}$ is that $S_{F3}$ changes the selection for the feature \emph{effort}. The characteristic \emph{manual} is chosen in $S_{F1}$ and the characteristic \emph{harvester} for $S_{F3}$. The individual score for user one increases as he prefers \emph{harvester} with $0.8$ over \emph{manual} with $0.6$. However, user two has an individual score reduction as her score changes from $0.8$ for \emph{manual} to $0.3$ for \emph{harvester}. The larger decrease in the score of user two causes a decrease in the overall score when comparing  $S_{F1}$ to $S_{F3}$ with a score of $0.55$ to $0.53$. The scores for both users are closer together for $S_{F1}$ however this doesn't necessarily have to be the case because if the preference of user two for harvester were to change to $0.6$ both configurations would have the same score. A different user preference aggregation strategy can change that.

Last, $S_{F1}$ and $S_{F4}$ differentiate in terms of characteristic choice for the feature \emph{indigenous}. The switch from \emph{moderate} to \emph{high} when changing from $S_{F1}$ to $S_{F4}$ causes an increase in the individual scoring function of user two. This is caused because her preference for \emph{moderate} is $0.6$ and for \emph{high} is $0.9$. This results in a score of $0.57$ for $S_{F4}$. Yet, the change that causes the preference scoring function to give a higher score entails a penalty as the characteristic \emph{high} is not part of the configuration state. This penalty causes the overall score to drop to $0.29$ compared to the score of $S_{F1}$ with $0.55$.
